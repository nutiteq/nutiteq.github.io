Nutiteq SDK is a replacement for Google Maps API (MapView) for Android, so it has all your usual mapping SDK features (map panning, vector/raster overlays etc) plus some extras: \r\n* 2.5/3D view: map tilting, rotating and 3D models\r\n* offline mapping (MBTiles, persistent caching etc)\r\n* supports any map projection, which makes it more usable for GIS apps\r\n\r\n![Screenshot with 3D models](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3573333/mapxt_3d_tallinn_device-2012-07-25-124845.png)\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nTo get started see [project Wiki pages](https://github.com/nutiteq/hellomap3d/wiki). It shows how to create a map and add layers on top of that.\r\n\r\n# Contribution \r\nWe welcome any kind of contributions: questions, pull requests, questions, feedback, wiki updates etc. Please join [nutiteq-dev@googlegroups.com] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nutiteq-dev) for discussions.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n* Nutiteq 3D SDK - commercial evaluation license, (c) Nutiteq Llc.
